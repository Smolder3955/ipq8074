 * Register tracing support.

 * Setting hw.ath.hal.alq=1 enables tracing of all register reads and
 * writes to the file /tmp/ath_hal.log.  The file format is a simple
 * fixed-size array of records.  When done logging set hw.ath.hal.alq=0
 * and then decode the file with the arcode program (that is part of the
 * HAL).  If you start+stop tracing the data will be appended to an
